OGLMan
======

OGLMan ("OpenGL Manager") is a bunch of convenience classes that ease the management of shaders, buffers and meshes in the modern shader based OpenGL. I created these to help me understand how OpenGL works. 

### Dependencies
- SFML 2.1 for the render window 
- GLEW 1.10.1 (MinGW version) to manage OpenGL function calls.
- Qt Creator 3.1.1, though not using Qt

### License
I don't care what you do with it, since there are better libraries that do this sort of stuff way better. However, if you actually somehow manage to find this useful, do drop me a love letter and say thanks (:
