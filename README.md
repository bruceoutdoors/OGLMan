OGLMan
======

OGLMan ("OpenGL Manager") is a bunch of convenience classes that ease the management of shaders, buffers and meshes in the modern shader based OpenGL. I created these to help me understand how OpenGL works. 

Uses SFML 2.1 for the render window and GLEW 1.10.1 (MinGW version) to manage OpenGL function calls.
